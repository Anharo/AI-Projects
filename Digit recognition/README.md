# Digit Recognition Model

This project is a digit recognition system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to predict digits (0-9) based on hand-drawn inputs provided through a simple web interface. Below, you will find an overview of the project, including how it works, its inspiration, and how to use it.

## Features
- A CNN-based model trained to recognize digits (0-9) from grayscale images.
- A user-friendly web interface where users can draw digits using their mouse.
- Real-time predictions displayed on the webpage.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by an assignment provided by [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/), where the focus was on building machine learning solutions for practical use cases. I expanded on this concept by creating a web-based interface to make it interactive and easy to use.

## How the Project Was Built
### 1. Model Training
- The digit recognition model was trained on the dataset provided as part of the Codebasics assignment.
- The training and testing were performed in a Jupyter Notebook, which has been uploaded to my **Machine Learning Repository**.
- The notebook includes step-by-step explanations of data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

### 2. Web Interface
- A simple webpage was created to allow users to draw digits using their mouse.
- The backend processes the drawn digit, converts it into a format suitable for the model, and then predicts the digit in real-time.
- The web scripting and deployment aspects were generated with the help of AI, ensuring a quick and efficient setup.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebook**: The complete Jupyter Notebook used for training the model is available in my Machine Learning Repository.
- **Web Interface Code**: The AI-generated script for the webpage and backend integration is included here.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the model script and launch the web application.
3. Use your mouse to draw a digit in the provided canvas.
4. The predicted digit will appear on the screen in real-time.
