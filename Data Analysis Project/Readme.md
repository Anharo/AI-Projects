# 📊 Data Analysis Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Projects Repository**! This repository contains all the data analysis projects I’ve worked on — including guided projects from learning platforms and self-initiated projects based on real-world datasets.

Currently, this repository features one guided project titled **"Drugged Islanders"**, exploring how memory is affected by anti-anxiety medication and emotional priming.

## 🧑‍🏫 Guided Projects

### 📌 [Drugged Islanders](Guided_Projects/Drugged_Islanders)

**Dataset**: [Memory Test on Drugged Islanders – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steveahn/memory-test-on-drugged-islanders-data)

#### 📖 Context:
This project investigates the **effects of anti-anxiety medication on memory recall**, particularly when participants are emotionally primed with either *happy* or *sad* memories. The experiment uses fictional "Islanders" modeled after human psychological behavior under external stimuli.

- **Drugs Tested**:
  - **A** – *Alprazolam (Xanax)*: Long-term effect
  - **T** – *Triazolam (Halcion)*: Short-term effect
  - **S** – *Sugar Tablet (Placebo)*

- **Dosage Groups**:
  - A: 1mg, 3mg, 5mg
  - T: 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 0.75mg
  - S: 1 tab, 2 tabs, 3 tabs

- **Study Design**:
  - Memory was tested daily for one week
  - Participants were primed with happy or sad memories 10 minutes prior to testing
  - The goal was to simulate memory and addiction effects under medication

#### 🧪 Key Analysis Tasks:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distributional Analysis by Drug Type and Dosage
- Impact of Mood (Happy vs Sad) on Memory Scores
- Visualizations of Mean Score Trends Across the Week
- Insights on Drug Efficacy and Potential Side Effects on Recall

#### 🧰 Tools Used:
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
